# Experimenting With Artificial Intelligence: Programming Pathfinding Algorithms in C++ With Unreal Engine 5
## Description
Letâ€™s make something to take back home as a souvenir! Join us in a beginner-friendly lab session on pathfinding algorithms for AI gameplay mechanics. Together, we will visually compare pathfinding algorithms and see them in action as an open-world game.

## Abstract
This hands-on lab session focuses on sharing the art and value of decision-making systems and pathfinding algorithms for machine learning applications. Understanding theoretical frameworks and heuristic strategies is necessary to build a foundational understanding of AI for research, games, and beyond. Through game development, we experience a snippet of AI by visualizing pathfinding algorithms, an entry point to exploring any AI domain.

Together, we visualize the applications and influence of real-time pathfinding through programmatically modeling with Metahumans in Unreal Engine 5 (UE5). This comes together as an open-world game compatible with their preferred platform including WebGL, iOS/Android, and VR headsets. Personal hardware is not required for participation but is recommended for playtesting.

## Set Up

Fork or clone the entire repo
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/debbieyuen/vscode-unityscripting
```

Make sure you have Git and Node.js. Then, install Yeoman and VS Code Extension Generator
```bash
$ npm install -g yo generator-code
```

Install the Axios API for the VSCode Extension
```bash
$ npm install axios
```

Install Fast XML Parser for the VSCode Extension
```bash
$ npm install fast-xml-parser
```

For the Unity project, install Git LFS
```bash
$ git lfs install
```

Within the Unity **Package Manager**, install `Unity Render Streaming` and `WebRTC` via git URL
```bash
com.unity.webrtc@2.4.0-exp.8
com.unity.renderstreaming@3.1.0-exp.6
```

Within the Unity **Render Streaming/ Render Streaming Wizard**, click on the **Download latest version of web app.** button. If you are on a Mac, run the following commands in terminal. 
```bash
chmod +x webserver_mac
./webserver_mac -p 3030
```

Create a new settings asset for Render Streaming and input the signaling type and URL.
